<h3>Rate Your Music Parser<h3>
<h4>Python<h4>
  
<p>This is a small project I made for myself, because I like to work with numbers and statistics. ðŸ“ˆ</p>
<p>It's a console application made with Python, no GUI and other fancy stuff, just black screen with commands.
The purpose of this app is to parse data exported by user from Rate Your Music web-site and calculate different statistic based on the data. Such as top of artists based on avarage score, top decades based on avarage score etc. For the application to work you need to have a functioning Rate Your Music account and export your data from there and put the file in the parent folder.</p>
